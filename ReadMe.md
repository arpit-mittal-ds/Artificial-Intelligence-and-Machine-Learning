## Motivation :)

There has been a critical shortage of engineers capable of building production machine learning models in the cloud. Strong software engineering skills mixed with a foundational knowledge of both cloud computing and machine learning is an effective template for machine learning engineering.


## What did I learn ?
The goal of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program was to equip learners with the ability to **build, deploy, and debug production machine learning models.** In addition, it taught critical skills in **operationalizing Machine Learning models and building pipelines.**


### Mastered the following skills:

Use the Azure Machine Learning platform

Operationalize Machine Learning on Azure

Correctly select the appropriate Machine Learning service and optimize it

Through this course I was able to enhance my skills by **building and deploying sophisticated ML solutions** using popular open source tools and **frameworks such as scikit-learn.**
Using **AzureMLâ€™s MLOps capabilities**, I gained experience in understanding ML models, protecting people and their data, and controlling the end-to-end ML lifecycle at scale.


### Course 1 

**Used Azure Machine Learning Studio to configure workspaces, run experiments, create, and run models.**

Created an Azure Machine Learning workspace

Managed experiment and compute contexts

Created and managed datastores and datasets

Used Azure Machine learning Designer to create models and training pipelines.

Used Azure Machine Learning SDK to run experiments and create pipelines

Created, ran and monitored pipelines

Automated and monitored experiments

Use AutoML

Managed, monitored, and explained models

## Course 2 - 

**Operationalized a machine learning model, including key activities such as logging, debugging, load-testing, elastic configuration, picking the hardware configuration, and exposing an API.**

Determined the appropriate cloud architecture for production deployment (i.e. GPU, elastic endpoints, etc)

Deployed machine learning model to Azure

Debug production issues with the machine learning model

Built logging for the machine learning model

Applied continuous delivery to the machine learning system with a batch inference pipeline

Made recommendations based on load testing outcomes

Built APIs for the machine learning model

Produced a web service through a pipeline, applying ML techniques, and measuring performance to identify optimizations
