## What is TinyML

TinyML is a field of study in Machine Learning and Embedded Systems that explores the types of models you can run on small, low-powered devices like microcontrollers. It enables low-latency, low power and low bandwidth model inference at edge devices.

When you take a picture, you want the machine learning magic to happen instantly. You don’t want to wait for the image to be sent to a data centre where it is being processed and sent back again. In this case, you want the machine learning model to run locally.

Advantages of TinyML

Low Latency: Since the model runs on the edge, the data doesn't have to be sent to a server to run inference. This reduces the latency of the output.

Low Power Consumption: As we discussed before, microcontrollers consume very little power. This enables them to run without being charged for a really long time.

Low Bandwidth: As the data doesn’t have to be sent to the server constantly, less internet bandwidth is used.

Privacy: Since the model is running on the edge, your data is not stored in any servers.

TinyML, is an emerging field that is at the intersection of machine learning and embedded systems.

An embedded system is a computing device that usually is small, or tiny,  that operates with low power, extremely low power.

So much so that some of these devices can run for days, weeks, months, sometimes even years on something like a coin cell battery.

And TinyML is all about taking just a small, little computing device and enabling it with machine learning smarts.

Together, the intersection of embedded systems and machine learning is going to unlock a whole new world
