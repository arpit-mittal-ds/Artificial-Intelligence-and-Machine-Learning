# WHAT IS AI

Simply put, AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key elements include:

**Machine learning** - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make prediction and draw conclusions from data.

**Anomaly detection** - The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.

**Computer vision** - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.

**Natural language processing** - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.

**Conversational AI** - The capability of a software "agent" to participate in a conversation.

## Machine Learning

Data scientists use data to **train ML models** that can make **predictions** and inferences based on the **relationships they find in the data.**

### EXAMPLE - [Yield](https://news.microsoft.com/transform/videos/yield-feed-world-without-wrecking-planet/) 

Yield is using machine learning to feed the world without wrecking the planet.

### EXAMPLE 

Suppose an environmental conservation organization wants volunteers to identify and catalog different species of wildflower using a phone app. Let's see how machine learning can be used to enable this scenario.

1. A team of botanists and scientists **collect data** on wildflower samples.

2. The team **labels** the samples with the correct species.

3. The labeled data is processed using an algorithm that **finds relationships** between the features of the samples and the labeled species.

4. The results of the algorithm are encapsulated in a **model.**

5. **When new samples are found by volunteers, the model can identify the correct species label.**


### MACHINE LEARNING IN MICROSOFT AZURE

Microsoft Azure provides the Azure Machine Learning service - a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. Azure Machine Learning provides the following features and capabilities:


**Automated machine learning**

This feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.

**Azure Machine Learning designer**

A graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.

**Data and compute management**

Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional data scientists can use to run data experiment code at scale.

**Pipelines**

Data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks.

## Anomaly Detection

Examples:

a software system to monitor credit card transactions and detect unusual usage patterns that might indicate fraud.

an application that tracks activity in an automated production line and identifies failures.
 
### Example 3 

A racing car telemetry system that uses sensors to proactively warn engineers about potential mechanical failures before they happen.

1. Sensors in the car collect telemetry, such as engine revolutions, brake temperature, and so on.

2. An anomaly detection model is trained to understand expected fluctuations in the telemetry measurements over time.

3. If a measurement occurs outside of the normal expected range, the model reports an anomaly that can be used to alert the race engineer to call the driver in for a pit stop to fix the issue before it forces retirement from the race.

### Anomaly detection in Microsoft Azure

[ Anomaly Detector service ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/)

provides an application programming interface (API) that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions.
