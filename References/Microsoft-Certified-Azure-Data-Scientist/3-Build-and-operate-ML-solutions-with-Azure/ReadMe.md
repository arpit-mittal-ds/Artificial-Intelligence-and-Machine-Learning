**The Azure resources created alongside a workspace include:**

A storage account - used to store files used by the workspace as well as data for experiments and model training.

An Application Insights instance, used to monitor predictive services in the workspace.

An Azure Key Vault instance, used to manage secrets such as authentication keys and credentials used by the workspace.

A container registry, created as-needed to manage containers for deployed models.
