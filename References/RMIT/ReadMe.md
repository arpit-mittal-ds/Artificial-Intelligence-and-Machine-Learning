• Select and justify a [heuristic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/heuristics.asp) to support the selection of the appropriate tool to solve a range of business problems.


• Analyse and recommend an appropriate analytical approach – e.g. machine learning techniques, AI models, deep learning – based on a range of problem-specific parameters – e.g. problem recognition, testing hypotheses, reproducibility and applicability of models – to solve data science problems.

• Evaluate and identify relevant data analysis options for managing and incorporating big data into decision making within an organisation.

• Use critical reflection to verify that the approach, reproducibility and accuracy of inputs and outputs of data science algorithms are ethical, valid and sustainable.

• Interpret the outputs of machine learning and effectively communicate this to decision makers in a range of contexts.

• Use ML Applications and analyse the outputs to provide additional clarity to support strategic decision making for an executive group.
