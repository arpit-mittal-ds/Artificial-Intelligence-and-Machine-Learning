# Notes

## What is Machine Learning ?

A field of study that gives computers the **ability to learn without being explicitly programmed**. 

eg. a computer playing by itself and improving.
More Experience -> Better Results

Machine learning is a subset of data science that deals with predictive modeling. 

In other words, **using data to create models** that can **predict unknown values.**

It works by **identifying relationships between data values** that describe characteristics of something - **its features** and the value we want to predict **the label**, and **encapsulating these relationships in a model** through a training process.


Usually, a data analysis project is designed to establish insights around a particular scenario or to test a hypothesis. 

### For example:

Suppose a university professor **collects data from data science students**, including the **number of lectures attended**, the hours spent studying, and **the final grade achieved** on the end of term exam. 

The professor could then take a sample of the data and analyze it to **determine if there is a relationship between the amount of study a student undertakes and the final grade they achieve.** 

They might use the data to **test a hypothesis** that only students who study for a minimum number of hours can expect to achieve a passing grade.

Or even prepare the data to **train a machine learning model that predicts a student's grade based on their study habits.**

## Supervised Learning Problems

We are given a dataset

We already know what our correct output should look like

Relationship between Inputs and Outputs exists

### Classificaiton vs Regression 

[Fundamentally, classification is about predicting a label and regression is about predicting a quantity](https://medium.com/quick-code/regression-versus-classification-machine-learning-whats-the-difference-345c56dd15f7)

**Given data about size of houses, predict their price**
**Predict whether a house will sell for less or more than a given price**
