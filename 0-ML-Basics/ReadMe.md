## What is Machine Learning ?

Machine learning is a subset of data science that deals with predictive modeling. 

In other words, **using data to create models** that can **predict unknown values.**

It works by **identifying relationships between data values** that describe characteristics of something - **its features** and the value we want to predict **the label**, and **encapsulating these relationships in a model** through a training process.


Usually, a data analysis project is designed to establish insights around a particular scenario or to test a hypothesis. 

### For example:

Suppose a university professor **collects data from data science students**, including the **number of lectures attended**, the hours spent studying, and **the final grade achieved** on the end of term exam. 

The professor could then take a sample of the data and analyze it to **determine if there is a relationship between the amount of study a student undertakes and the final grade they achieve.** 

They might use the data to **test a hypothesis** that only students who study for a minimum number of hours can expect to achieve a passing grade.

Or even prepare the data to **train a machine learning model that predicts a student's grade based on their study habits.**
